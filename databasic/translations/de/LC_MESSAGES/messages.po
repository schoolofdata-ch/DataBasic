#~ "Understanding the data in your csv "
#~ "file is the first step in "
#~ "analyzing it for stories. Looking at "
#~ "individual columns can help you identify"
#~ " questions that might be fun to "
#~ "ask about your data.  For instance, "
#~ "is it surprising that "
#~ "\"%(most_common_value)s\" is the most frequent"
#~ " value in the %(random_column_name)s "
#~ "column?  Does it make any sense to"
#~ " compare the %(random_column_name2)s column "
#~ "to the %(random_column_name3)s column?  Are"
#~ " there any other datasets you could"
#~ " find to ask interesting questions "
#~ "about the %(random_column_name)s column?  <br"
#~ " /><br />Asking these types of "
#~ "questions is the first step in "
#~ "understanding the data you have, and "
#~ "what kind of stories you can find"
#~ " in it. Check out our <a "
